# Touch Device Manager

**Touch Manager** is a small, functional Tkinter app that demonstrates the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** framework.  
It aims to provide practical examples of what MVC can look like, how parts should be organised, and how principles like the **Observer pattern** behave in practice.

## What It Is

Touch Manager is a basic interface that allows you to enable and disable touch devices (such as touchscreens and touchpads) in multiple modes.

It demonstrates:
- Basic GUI features using Tkinter
- How a GUI can be structured around MVC
- How different components interact within that structure

## What It Isn’t

This repository is **not a rulebook**, nor is it perfect or authoritative.

It is intended to:
- Provide concrete, readable examples of MVC concepts
- Serve as a learning reference, not a strict guide

Keep in mind:
- There are many design principles beyond MVC, and some may suit your app (or this app) better
- Tkinter is **not an ideal candidate** for MVC-style layouts
- This implementation exists primarily as a **demonstration**

## Notes

If you’d like to explore more MVC examples in Python, you may find it helpful to look at other GitHub repositories and gists.

For example, **[julesTk](https://github.com/ajongbloets/julesTk)** is a simple MVC framework whose source code was used in minor parts of this repository.
